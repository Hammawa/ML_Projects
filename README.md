## Machine learning projects

### Breast Cancer Classification
* Predict whether a cancer cell is benign or malignant.
* Cleaned and preprocessed data using Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
* Evaluated two models Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Logistic Regression and used GridSearchCV to optimize models. 
* Demonstrated dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis (PCA)

### Loan Classification
* Predict whether a clientâ€™s loan is paid off or in collection
* Performed visual data analysis with matplotlib and seaborn, preprocessed data with feature extraction and data standardization using Pandas and Scikit-learn.
* Tested four supervised classifier models KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, and Logistic Regression.
* Evaluated each model using Scikit-learn to gather Jaccard score, f1 score, and log-loss. Recommended Logistic Regression with an accuracy of 76.9% on the test set.
